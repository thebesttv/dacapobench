To update the docs:

The documentation is generated using forrest (http://xml.apache.org/forrest/).

The current procedure is:

- checkout xml-forrest module
- run: build.sh(bat) dist
- follow instructions to set FORREST_HOME and path
- go to xml-fop directory
- run forrest(.bat)

The documents will then be placed in build/site/

NOTE: the compliance.html currently does not work, it can be fixed by
adding the dtd ref to: build/tmp/context/resources/schema/catalog
and placing the dtd in: build/tmp/context/resources/schema/dtd/

To update website
- put the generated docs into the xml-site module targets/fop/
  this could be done by simlinking the destination to the targets/fop
- commit the documents
