      <title>System Requirements</title>
      <p>The following software must be installed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Java 1.2.x or later Runtime Environment.</li>
        <li>FOP. The <link href="download.html">FOP distribution</link> includes all libraries that you will need to run a basic FOP installation. These can be found in the xml-fop/lib directory. These libraries include the following:
          <ul>
            <li><jump href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-j/index.html">Apache Xerces-J</jump> for XML parsing. You can use other XML parsers which support SAX and DOM.</li>
            <li><jump href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/index.html">Apache Xalan-J</jump>, an XSLT processor.</li>
            <li><jump href="http://xml.apache.org/batik/">Apache Batik</jump>, an SVG library.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The following sofware is optional, depending on your needs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Graphics libraries. Support for some graphics formats requires additional packages. See <link href="graphics.html">FOP: Graphics Formats</link> for details.</li>
        <li>PDF encryption. See <link href="pdfencryption.html">FOP: PDF Encryption</link> for details.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition, the following system requirements apply:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you will be using FOP to process SVG, you must do so in a graphical environment. See <link href="graphics.html#batik">FOP: Graphics (Batik)</link> for details.</li>
      </ul>

      <title>Installation</title>
      <section id="install-instruct">
        <title>Instructions</title>
        <p>Basic FOP installation consists of first unzipping the <code>.gz</code> file that is the distribution medium, then unarchiving the resulting <code>.tar</code> file in a directory/folder that is convenient on your system. Please consult your operating system documentation or Zip application software documentation for instructions specific to your site.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="install-problems">
        <title>Problems</title>
        <p>Some Mac OSX users have experienced filename truncation problems using Stuffit to unzip and unarchive their distribution media. This is a legacy of older Mac operating systems, which had a 31-character pathname limit. Several Mac OSX users have recommended that Mac OSX users use the shell command <code>tar -xzf</code> instead.</p>

    <section id="standalone-start">
      <title>Starting FOP as a Standalone Application</title>
      <p>The usual and recommended practice for starting FOP from the command line is to run the batch file fop.bat (Windows) or the shell script fop.sh (Unix/Linux).
If you write your own scripts, be sure to review these standard scripts to make sure that you get your environment properly configured.</p>
      <p>The standard scripts for starting FOP require that the environment variable JAVA_HOME be set to a path pointing to the appropriate Java installation on your system. Macintosh OSX includes a Java environment as part of its distribution. We are told by Mac OSX users that the path to use in this case is <code>/Library/Java/Home</code>. <strong>Caveat: </strong>We suspect that, as Apple releases new Java environments and as FOP upgrades the minimum Java requirements, the two will inevitably not match on some systems. Please see <jump href="http://developer.apple.com/java/faq">Java on Mac OSX FAQ</jump> for information as it becomes available.</p>

    <section id="check-input">
      <title>Using Xalan to Check XSL-FO Input</title>
      <p>FOP sessions that use -xml and -xsl input instead of -fo input are actually controlling two distinct conversions: Tranforming XML to XSL-FO, then formatting the XSL-FO to PDF (or another FOP output format).
Although FOP controls both of these processes, the first is included merely as a convenience and for performance reasons.
Only the second is part of FOP's core processing.
If a user has a problem running FOP, it is important to determine which of these two processes is causing the problem.
If the problem is in the first process, the user's stylesheet is likely the cause.
The FOP development team does not have resources to help with stylesheet issues, although we have included links to some useful <link href="resources.html#specs">Specifications</link> and <link href="resources.html#articles">Books/Articles</link>.
If the problem is in the second process, FOP may have a bug or an unimplemented feature that does require attention from the FOP development team.</p>
      <note>The user is always responsible to provide correct XSL-FO code to FOP.</note>
      <p>In the case of using -xml and -xsl input, although the user is responsible for the XSL-FO code that is FOP's input, it is not visible to the user. To make the intermediate FO file visible, the FOP distribution includes xalan.bat (Windows batch file) and xalan.sh (Unix/Linux script), which run only the first (transformation) step, and write the results to a file.</p>
      <note>When asking for help on the FOP mailing lists, <em>never</em> attach XML and XSL to illustrate the issue. Always run the xalan script and send the resulting XSL-FO file instead. Of course, be sure that the XSL-FO file is correct before sending it.</note>
      <p>
        The scripts are invoked the same way that <link href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/commandline.html">Xalan</link> is:
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>xalan -in xmlfile -xsl file -out outfile</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that there are some subtle differences between the "fop" and "xalan" command lines.

    <section id="memory">
      <title>Memory Usage</title>
      <p>
FOP can consume quite a bit of memory, even though this has been continually improved.
This is partly inherent to the formatting process and partly caused by implementation choices.
All FO processors currently on the market have memory problems with certain layouts.
      </p>
      <p>
If you are running out of memory when using FOP, here are some ideas that may help:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
Increase memory available to the JVM. See <link href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/tooldocs/solaris/java.html">the -Xmx option</link> for more information.
          <!--<warning>-->
(Warning: It is usually unwise to increase the memory allocated to the JVM beyond the amount of physical RAM, as this will generally cause significantly slower performance.)
          <!--</warning>-->
        </li>
        <li>
Avoid forward references.
Forward references are references to some later part of a document.
Examples include page number citations which refer to pages which follow the citation, tables of contents at the beginning of a document, and page numbering schemes that include the total number of pages in the document (<link href="faq.html#pagenum">"page N of TOTAL"</link>).
Forward references cause all subsequent pages to be held in memory until the reference can be resolved, i.e. until the page with the referenced element is encountered.
Forward references may be required by the task, but if you are getting a memory overflow, at least consider the possibility of eliminating them.
A table of contents might be eliminated, relying on PDF bookmarks instead.
Or it might be moved to the end of the document without dimishing its value very much.
Or, in some circumstances, the paper could even be reshuffled after printing.
        </li>
        <li>
Avoid large images, especially if they are scaled down.
If they need to be scaled, scale them in another application upstream from FOP.
For many image formats, memory consumption is driven mainly by the size of the image file itself, not its dimensions (width*height), so increasing the compression rate may help.
        </li>
        <li>
Use multiple page sequences.
FOP starts rendering after the end of a page sequence is encountered.
While the actual rendering is done page-by-page, some additional memory allocated for other purposes could be freed after the page sequence has been rendered.
        </li>
        <li>
Break down large tables.
If you don't use table headers and footers, just start a new table every N rows.
With headers and footers, consider integrating them as normal table rows, or, if they are used at page breaks, try to put the information into static content.
You can then use markers to change them.
        </li>
        <li>
Clear the image cache. At the moment, images in the cache are not released automatically when an OutOfMemoryError is imminent.
Starting with version 0.20.5 however, you can call <code>org.apache.fop.image.FopImageFactory.resetCache()</code> to empty the 
<jump href="graphics.html#caching">image cache</jump>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
There are currently some bugs which cause FOP to go into a nonterminating loop, which will also often result in a memory overflow.
A characteristic symptom is continuous <link href="faq.html#boxoverflow">box overflows</link> in the log.
Most of these loops are triggered by elements that do not fit in the available space, such as big images or an improperly specified width in nested block elements.
The only workaround is to locate such problems and correct them.
      </p>
      <p>
One of FOP's stated design goals is to be able to process input of arbitrary size.
Addressing this goal is one of the prime motivations behind the <link href="dev/index.html">FOP Redesign</link>.
