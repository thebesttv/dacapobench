  <title>FOP 0.20.5</title>
  <p>This is the last planned release in the 0.20.x series (aka maintenance branch).</p>
  <p>Important changes since the last release (0.20.4):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Some hyphenation patterns (cs, da, de, de_DR, el, en, en_US, fr, nl,
      no, sk, tr) have been removed due to licensing reasons
      (en_GB hyphenation has been renamed to en).
      We're still working on this issue
      (see <link href="http://nagoya.apache.org/wiki/apachewiki.cgi?FOPAudits/March2003">
      Wiki</link> for details).
    </li>
    <li>Documentation is now built with <link href="http://xml.apache.org/forrest/">
        Forrest</link> (version 0.4). You need to install Forrest if you want build the docs
        yourself. (See
        <link href="http://xml.apache.org/forrest/your-project.html">Using Forrest</link>)
    </li>
    <li>The following JARs have been updated:
        Xerces to version 2.2.1, Xalan to version 2.4.1 and Batik to version 1.5beta4.
    </li>
    <li>FOP has been compiled with Jimi support, but Jimi is not included in the
        FOP distribution. To use it, first download
        <link href="http://java.sun.com/products/jimi/">Jimi</link>, then extract
        the archive, then
        copy JimiProClasses.zip to FOP's lib dir and rename it to jimi-1.0.jar.
    </li>
    <li>FOP has been compiled with JAI support, but JAI is not included in the
        FOP distribution. To use it, simply install
        <link href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai">JAI</link>.
    </li>
    <li>Links in PDF won't generate multiple link rectangles anymore. If this causes
        a problem you can set the system property "links.merge" to "no".
    </li>
    <li>FOP has been compiled with cryptography support. See <link href="pdfencryption.html">
      PDF encryption</link> for details about installation and usage.
    </li>
    <li>The behaviour of leader has changed. See
      <link href="http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19341">bug #19341</link>,
      <link href="http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19465">bug #19465</link>
      and <code>leader.fo</code> (examples).
    </li>
    <li>
      For a more detailed list of changes, see the CHANGES file in the root of the
      FOP distribution.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <title>FOP 0.20.4</title>
  <p>Important changes since 0.20.3:</p>
    <ul>
       <li>FOP should now work with any JAXP1.1 compliant parser/transformer.
         It has been successfully tested with Xerces/Xalan, Saxon and JDK1.4
         (which includes Crimson and Xalan).
       </li>
       <li>The following JARs have been updated:
         Xerces to version 2.0.1, Xalan to version 2.3.1 and Batik to version 1.5beta2.
      </li>
      <li>FOP has been compiled with Jimi support this time
        but you still have to download
        <link href="http://java.sun.com/products/jimi/">Jimi</link>
        and copy it to lib/ to get PNG support (no need to build FOP yourself though).
      </li>
      <li>Building FOP with JDK1.2 does not work. Running is ok except
        support for additional truetype fonts in AWT Viewer.
      </li>
      <li>Logging has been changed from LogKit to Avalon's Logger Interface.
        (see <link href="embedding.html">Embedding</link> for details).
      </li>
      <li>Building under JDK 1.4:
         You need to add a method in
         <code>src/org/apache/fop/svg/PDFGraphics2D.java</code>
         (search for jdk1.4 and remove the comments)
      </li>
      <li>To decrease the size of the distributions, ant, xml-docs, design-docs
        and the hyphenation sources have been removed from the binary distribution.
        Javadocs have been removed from the source distribution (use
        <code>build javadocs</code> to generate them).
      </li>
      <li>Documentaion generation is broken in the maintenance branch at the moment
       (Stylebook needs xerces1). The docs for this release are generated from the trunk.
      </li>
      <li>
        For a more detailed list of changes, see the CHANGES file in the root of the FOP distribution.
      </li>
      </ul>
