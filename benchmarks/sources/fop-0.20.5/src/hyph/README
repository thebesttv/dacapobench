Hyphenation

Fop comes with some hyphenation pattern. If you need a hyphenation 
pattern which isn't included in the distribution, do the following: 

1. get the TeX hyphenation pattern file and turn it into an xml file 
   which conforms to the hyphenation.dtd in the sub directory /hyph

2. name this new file following this schema: languageCode_countryCode.xml. 
   If you don't need a country code, leave it away, p.e. the file name 
   for an American english hyphenation pattern would look like this:  
   en_US.xml. 
   For an Italian file: it.xml. 
   Language and country codes must be the same as in xsl:fo, that is follow 
   ISO 639 <http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/related/iso639.txt> and 
   ISO 3166 <http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/related/iso3166.txt> 
   respectively. 
   NOTE: The ISO 639/ISO 3166 convention is that language names are
   written in lower case, while country codes are written in upper case.

3. If you have build your new hyphenation pattern file successfully there are
   two ways to make it accessible to Fop. 
   a) Put this new file into the directory /hyph and rebuild Fop. The file will 
      be picked up and added to the fop.jar.
   b) Put the file into a directory of your choice and specify this directory
      in the userconfig.xml in the entry <hyphenation-dir>

4. If the license of your hyphenation pattern file does allow it, please send 
   it to the list fop-dev, so it can be made part of the Fop distribution.
